# Contributing to the bot
First thing, thanks for wanting to contribute!

When you want to contribute, always feel free to fork the project. If you've made something awesome, discuss it through Discord and if it's something we feel is useful, create a pull request. After a review, we'll try to provide fair criticism or merge it.

If you're not a coder, no problem! Just create an issue following the ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md or shoot a message through Discord https://discord.gg/SFYVQNE
